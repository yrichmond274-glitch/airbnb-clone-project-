## 🧰 Technology Stack

The **AirBnB Clone Project** uses a combination of powerful technologies to deliver a reliable, scalable, and interactive web application.  
Each technology plays a specific role in the project’s architecture — from backend logic to database management and frontend interactivity.

### 🐍 1. Python
**Purpose:** The main programming language used throughout the project.  
Python powers the backend logic, object-oriented models, and server-side processing.

### 🌐 2. Django / Flask
**Purpose:** A web framework used to build RESTful APIs and manage the backend structure of the application.  
- **Django** (or **Flask**) handles routing, authentication, and server–client communication efficiently.

### 🗄️ 3. MySQL / PostgreSQL
**Purpose:** The database management system that stores all user data, property listings, bookings, and reviews.  
It ensures secure, reliable data storage and supports complex queries for the application.

### 🧱 4. HTML
**Purpose:** The backbone of the frontend, defining the structure and layout of the web pages users interact with.

### 🎨 5. CSS
**Purpose:** Used to style the web pages, improving the visual appeal, layout, and overall user experience.
